### What drives me: 
- Real-World Impact: I enjoy seeing the projects I develop being utilized by others. My goal is to use my ability to code to make a tangible difference in the world, or more modestly, provide a solution to a problem. Whether it is building a simple website for a small business to increase their outreach or simply building something for myself, I love seeing the practical benefits of writing code. 
- Problem Solving: I thrive on challenges. Each new problem is an opportunity to innovate and push the boundaries of what I can create with code. I strive to challenge myself more with each project I build, implementing new technologies or more sophisticated features. My main goal is to grow as a developer. 

### Continuous growth:
- Committed to continuous learning. I am always pushing to level up my skills. Reflecting back on my previous projects is always a good way to keep myself motivated. 
- Benefiting significantily from The Odin Project, I am a firm believer in collaboration and community. Sharing knowledge and learning from others in the field is a key part of my growth as a developer. I hope to give back to the community in the same way The Odin Project and other open source learning platforms gave to me.
- Each project is a new adventure and an opportunity to improve and grow.
