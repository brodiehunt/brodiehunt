Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate full-stack developer based in Sydney, Australia. I specialise in the MERN stack, leveraging MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js to craft dynamic and responsive web applications.

Skills: REACT / NODE / EXPRESS / MONGODB / JS / HTML / CSS

What drives me: 
- 🌏  Real-World Impact: I enjoy seeing the projects I develop being utilized by others. My goal is to use my ability to code to make a tangible difference in the world, or more - modestly, provide a solution to a problem. Whether it is building a simple website for a small business to increase their outreach, contributing the open source community, or simply building something for myself, I love seeing the practical benefits of writing code. 
- 🧩 Problem Solving: I thrive on challenges. Each new problem is an opportunity to innovate and push the boundaries of what I can create with code. I strive to challenge myself more with each project I build, implementing new technologies or more sophisticated features. My main goal is to grow as a developer. 

Being a self taught dev:
- 📚 Continuous learning is my mantra. I am always pushing to increase my knowledge as a developer. Reflecting back on my previous projects is always a good way to keep myself motivated. 
- 🤝 Benefiting significantily from The Odin Project, I am a firm believer in collaboration and community. Sharing knowledge and learning from others in the field is a key part of my growth as a developer. I hope to give back to the community in the same way The Odin Project and other open source learning platforms gave to me.
- 🚀 Each project is a new adventure, and I am always on the lookout for the next exciting challenge in the world of web development.
